  <h2>About</h2>
  <h3>Netneutrality</h3>
  <p>
  Netneutrality is the principle that all data on the internet is
  transported using best effort. This includes not discriminating for
  origin and service. Netneutrality and whether legal obligations for
  providers need to exist to obey it is currently under debate in Europe
  and the US. The european commission frequently stated the need for data
  on Violations of Netneutrality - this data exists.

  <h3>This Map</h3>
  <p>
  This map shows data from <a
  href="http://www.measurementlab.net/measurement-lab-tools#tool2">Glasnost</a>
  one of the measurementlab tools for examining your interent connection.
  We map the percentage of tests where violations of netneutrality was
  discovered worldwide.
  </p>
  <p>
  This map was created by <a href="http://tentacleriot.eu">Michael
  Bauer</a> using several datasources: Above mentioned <a
  href="http://www.measurementlab.net/data">Data from measurementlab</a>,
  <a href="http://www.team-cymru.org/Services/ip-to-asn.html">Team Cymrus
  Whois server for provider detection</a> and the <a
  href="http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolite">Geolite</a> database for
  geomapping IPs. Python and postgres is used for parsing, filtering and
  analyzing the data. <a href="http://jvectormap.com/">jvectormap</a> is
  used for visualization.

  This map wouldn't be possible if I didn't have support from these people:
  Tom Lohninger, thanks for the initial push and feedback; Leonhard Preis,
  thanks for the server resources (700Gig is a lot of data);
